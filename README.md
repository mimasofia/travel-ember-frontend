TravelDoc

The app:
This app is designed for any one whoe wants to plan a trip. The idea was that when a person plans a trip they have to pack and many times its hard to remember what a person needs to take a specific place. This app is designed to help with that. The user add places they want to visit. Then when they click on the place name they are directed to a place where they can add items they want/ need to take on the trip. For example, someone wants to go to Spain, they would need a Passport which you wouldn't need if you where goingto somewhere more local. You can remove items from the list and add new ones as well as add new places to vist that would have their own individual list of items

Unsolved Issues:
One of the issues I have is that when a user does `/new` it takes then to that route but doesn't allow the user to do anything with it unless the are signed in. It also happens with `/change-password` which was already built in the template

Planning:
 After the back end was done I moved on to the frontend. This is where I used Ember. I started out by trying to get a show on the first resource for a person. So they could see a list of their places. Then I moved to delete. Once I got those working I went on to  create and update. Create was one of the harder ones for me in this project. Once I was fully able to do all CRUD actions of the single resource I moved on to trying to add the second resource and did similar process. For this project I used the issue queue more and it was really helpful (Thanks Mike, Chris, Jordan). This helped me be able to do most of CRUD on the second resource.

Technologies:
For the frondend I used Ember Framework

User Stories:
