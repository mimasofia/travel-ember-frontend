  {{!-- <p class='app-explain'><span class='title-name'>TravelDoc</span> is an application where you can make a list of all the
    places you would like to go to. Once you have saved the name of the place, you
  can click on it and add all the items you would like to take to that place like a
  passport or sunglasses. Each place will have its own separate list of items to take
  with you.</p>

  <p class='app-explain'> This application was inspired by all the times I have traveled. It was always hard to
  keep track of all the things I needed to take to each place I traveled to. Especially when going from a place that
  was going through a winter to a place that was sunny and 90 degrees Farenheit. So I decided to make an application
  that would allow a user to make their own list of items and hace unique lists with each new place. Hope you
  enjoy using <span class='title-name'>TravelDoc</span>.</p> --}}
